# Build your own Excel

A Javascript version of a talk by Tomas Petricek (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnm71YEt_lI) showing how to build a simle version of Excel based on functional principles. This javascript version use [Preact](https://preactjs.com) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) instead of [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/) and [Fable](https://fable.io) with [F#](https://fsharp.org).

It is a good introduction to functional principles and the Elm architecture that's is showcased in the talk and this code.
